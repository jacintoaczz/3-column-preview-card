## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I used this challenge to practice the _:nth-child_ pseudo-selector usage and it's applicability. Thought it would be fun to use it on the cards since it would allow me to avoid creating classes for each one and improve the readbility of the code a bit.
